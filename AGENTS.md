# AGENTS.md — working rules for this repo

Read `PROJECT.md` first; it is the specification. This file is how to work, not what to build.

## Phase status

Build phases are `PROJECT.md` §17, one chat per phase. This block is how a fresh session finds the current position; the phase that finishes updates it in its own commit.

| Phase | State | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Skeleton | complete | `47be387` |
| 2 — Store, history, git | **next** | — |
| 3–11 | not started | — |

Carried forward from Phase 1: one §17 check is still unverified — `Ctrl+C` on `npm run dev` from a **Git Bash (mintty)** window, with a remote configured, leaving `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD` at 0 and no surviving `node`. The PowerShell case passed against a real console `CTRL_C_EVENT`; mintty is a pty, not a console, so that one needs the owner at a terminal.

## How we work

1. **Spec before code.** `PROJECT.md` and `AGENTS.md` came first; application code starts only when the owner asks for Phase 1.
2. **`PROJECT.md` opens with a Decisions section**: every call left open in the brief, one line of reasoning each. Keep it current when a decision changes.
3. **One phase at a time, in `PROJECT.md` §17 order.** Show a plan and wait for approval → build → run that phase's acceptance checks and report results honestly, failures included → commit → stop. Never roll into the next phase unprompted.
4. **One commit per phase, and it uses a development prefix.** `code:` for source and configuration, `docs:` for `PROJECT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the rest of the written spec. The other prefixes in the §8 vocabulary — `task:`, `knowledge:`, `chat:`, `settings:`, `file:` — belong to the running app: each describes a change to data under `data/`, is written by `runBatch`, and renders in the history mirror as `· task ·`. A phase build is never a `task:` commit. Messages read as if the owner wrote them. No AI attribution, no co-author trailers, no "generated with" footers, anywhere in this repo.
5. **If a phase is bigger than it looked, say so and propose a split** rather than quietly building all of it.
6. **If it is unclear whether something is a project feature or personal to the owner, ask.** Project = code, `seed/`, docs. Personal = anything under `data/`.
7. **Prefer the boring solution.** Before adding a dependency, an abstraction, or a file over ~300 lines, say why first and wait.
8. **Update the Phase status block as the last step of every phase**, inside that phase's own commit: move the phase to complete with its hash, name the next one, and carry forward anything left unverified. The next session starts there.

## Hard rules (from `PROJECT.md` §1)

- No state library, ORM, component library, or CSS framework. No abstraction until three concrete uses.
- Runtime dependency budget 12 (not counting next/react/react-dom); 8 are allocated in `PROJECT.md` Decision 28.
- Secrets live only in `.env.local`. Nothing resembling a key is ever written under `data/` or committed; the pre-commit hook enforces it.
- Every write goes through `runBatch()` in `lib/history/batch.ts`. `lib/store/` is the only module that touches the filesystem; `lib/agent/` is the only module that talks to a model provider.
- Source files stay under ~300 lines; split by feature, not by layer.

## Stack and commands

Next.js 15 (App Router) · TypeScript strict · Node 24 · plain CSS with custom-property tokens · vitest.

```
npm install            # postinstall sets core.hooksPath=.githooks on every machine
npm run dev            # scripts/dev.mjs → next dev, flushes git push on exit
npm run init           # seed/ → data/ (refuses if data/ is non-empty)
npm test               # vitest
npm run history -- list | undo <batch> | redo <batch>
npm run kb:check       # orphans, broken links, size caps
npm run check-secrets  # also runs from .githooks/pre-commit
npm run publish-check  # readiness for the public remote
```

## Conventions

- **Module header** on every source file: one line saying what it owns, then a `Failure behavior:` paragraph saying what happens when it breaks (degrade this feature, never the page).
- **Z-index tiers:** 20 in-scroll surfaces · 30 panels and bars · 40 toasts and modals. No other values.
- **No `enum`, `const enum`, `namespace`, or parameter properties (`constructor(private x)`) under `lib/`.** `scripts/*.mjs` import those files through plain Node, which strips types rather than compiling, and all four need emitted runtime code. `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` accept them happily; only the CLI breaks, and only at runtime — Phase 2 is where this first bites, since `lib/history/` is the first multi-file module the CLI imports. `lib/`→`lib/` imports carry the `.ts` extension for the same reason (`PROJECT.md` Decision 44).
- **Timers are never correctness.** Wait on the observable consequence; a timeout is a failure guard.
- **Dirty-check writes.** Never write a value that is already set.
- **Atomic file writes** (tmp + rename) in the store; whole-file writes, never read-modify-write of shared arrays.
- **LF everywhere.** `.gitattributes` forces `eol=lf`; the store normalizes CRLF to LF before writing. Byte-for-byte checks compare hashes, not `git diff`.
- **Frontmatter keys are camelCase and identical to the TypeScript field names** (`createdAt`, `estimateMin`, `parentId`). One convention for every file under `data/`; there is no mapping layer at the store boundary.
- Dates: date-only `YYYY-MM-DD`, date-time `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` in `settings.timezone`; timestamps ISO with offset. Paths in data files are relative to `data/`.
- Model IDs and effort come from `data/settings/settings.json`; nothing hardcodes a model.
- Tests live beside the code as `*.test.ts`; pure modules (`lib/chat/`, `lib/schedule/`, `lib/history/undo.ts`, `lib/store/frontmatter.ts`) must have them.

## Where to look things up

- Data shapes and file formats: `PROJECT.md` §4. Store surface: §5. History and undo: §7. Git sync: §8.
- Chat tree, streaming, annotations: `PROJECT.md` §16, with code to port cited from `HANDOFF-CHAT.md` (read only its `PORTABLE`/`ADAPT` parts). `HANDOFF-CHAT.md` and `BUILD_PROMPT.md` are private and are dropped by `npm run publish`; never make the spec depend on them.
- Claude API: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — `messages.stream`, `messages.parse`, `output_config.effort`; adaptive thinking is the default, send no `thinking` param. Agent SDK: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()`; verify option names against the installed version before use.
- Weather: Open-Meteo forecast and geocoding endpoints, no key, attribution required (`PROJECT.md` §10.1).
